# /debug Flaky mode (Group A — symptom-first → cause, loop reproducer)

Per master plan §3 compression matrix row "Flaky": ALL 17 steps active, with REPRODUCE in loop mode.

Symptom: "X is flaky / sometimes fails". Race / state-dependent / external-API timing.

## Iron Laws (verbatim from `~/.claude/skills/_iron_laws.md`)

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

---

## Engine reuse

Flaky mode reuses the S3 17-step engine via shared `_run_engine(symptom, mode='flaky', flags)`. Cmd_bug behavior is unchanged (regression invariant — verified post-ship).

---

## Loop semantics (Step 1 REPRODUCE delta)

- Run reproducer N times (default `--runs=10`).
- Per-run record: `(run#, outcome, fingerprint_hash)`.
- Output table → `~/.ship/<bug-slug>/experiments/flaky-runs.md`:
  ```
  | run | outcome     | fingerprint   |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1   | pass        | <sha8>        |
  | 2   | fail        | err-A-<sha8>  |
  ...
  ```
- Fingerprint frequency table — count distinct failure modes by hash.

In `--dry-run` mode, synthesize 10 fixture rows mixing pass/fail to exercise the path.

## Step 1.5 MINIMISE (flaky variant — added 2026-04-29)

After REPRODUCE captures the loop fail-rate, MINIMISE shrinks the env/config until the smallest setup that still produces fail-rate ≥ **30%** over N runs. Pocock/skills `diagnose` (MIT) — flaky shape.

- Strip env vars / data rows / concurrency level / setup steps **one at a time**.
- Re-run the loop after each strip.
- KEEP the strip if fail-rate stays ≥30%; REVERT if it drops.
- Halt when no further strip leaves fail-rate above the threshold.

Output:
- `experiments/repro-min-flaky.sh` — smallest deterministic flaky-reproducing script
- `state/minimise-log.md` — per-strip table: `# | Removed | New fail-rate | Decision`

Why 30%: below that, run-count to confirm flakiness explodes (you'd need >50 runs to distinguish 5% flaky from 0%). 30% gives signal-to-noise within 10 runs.

## Hypothesis priors (Step 6 GEN auto-seeded)

Race-pattern set:
- `H1: thread-safety` — concurrent access without lock
- `H2: async-order` — promise resolution order non-deterministic
- `H3: time-dependent` — clock skew, timeout, scheduling jitter
- `H4: state-leak` — prior run's state bleeds into next
- `H5: external-API-timing` — upstream provider variance

These are starting points; Step 6 still requires a single primary hypothesis "I think X because Y" per Iron Law #1.

---

## Step 10 CLASSIFY (Flaky-specific verdict thresholds)

| Failures / 10 runs | Verdict | Action |
|---|---|---|
| <2 | `intermittent_low` | log + monitor; no escalation |
| 2..7 | `flaky-confirmed` | continue 17-step engine to root cause |
| >7 | `mostly-broken-not-flaky` | abort flaky mode, re-run as `/debug bug` |

Exit codes: 0=intermittent_low, 1=flaky-confirmed, 4=mostly-broken-not-flaky, 2=invalid, 3=inconclusive.

---

## Multi-round protocol

Flaky mode benefits most from `~/.claude/rules/ship.md` § Debug-round isolation. Each loop iteration appended to `experiments/observations.md` as `[single-point]`. After N runs, the aggregate becomes `[N-comparison, N=10]` if all-else-equal preserved.

## Output

JSON to stdout + `experiments/flaky-runs.md` + ledger entry.
